/**
 * Snapshots of a project's working tree that never touch the project's own repository.
 *
 * Each project gets a SHADOW git directory under the mu home. Every command runs with `GIT_DIR`,
 * `GIT_WORK_TREE` and `GIT_INDEX_FILE` pointing into it (see `shadowEnv`), so the user's `.git` (index,
 * HEAD, stash, hooks, refs) is never read for writing, and a folder that is no repository at all works
 * the same way. git never adds a path with a `.git` component, so the real repository is not copied either.
 *
 * What goes into a snapshot: everything the project's `.gitignore` does not ignore, minus a built-in
 * list of heavy folders and secret files, minus mu's own folders (the snapshots themselves among them)
 * and minus files over a size cap. What a restore may touch follows from that: only paths that are in
 * one of the two trees it compares. An ignored or oversized file is in neither, so it is never
 * overwritten and never deleted.
