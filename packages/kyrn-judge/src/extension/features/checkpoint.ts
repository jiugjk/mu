 * Checkpoints of the working tree, and a rewind the judge helps decide.
 *
 * Before the first tool call of a user turn that can change files, the working tree is snapshotted into

 * `/rewind` puts the files back and moves the conversation to before that turn with pi's own tree
 * navigation, leaving one `kyrn.rewind` message about what was abandoned. When the monitor sees the agent
 * go in circles, `turn.rewind` asks the judge whether this is a dead end; a confident yes PROPOSES the
 * rewind to the user. Nothing here rewinds on its own, and any failure leaves pi's plain behaviour.
 *
 * A session goes without checkpoints, and says so once in one line, where a snapshot would copy what is
 * no project: the home folder (or one that holds it), mu's own folders, or a first snapshot past
 * `maxFiles` / `maxTotalMb`. Copying only the files a turn touches is no way out: a checkpoint is taken
 * before the turn's first change, when nobody knows which files the turn will change (a shell command
 * names none), and a rewind would then claim to restore a state it never saw.
