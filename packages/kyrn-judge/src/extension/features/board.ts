 * stops; only when it sees something new does a model that explains well
 * write the board again. The board is for the person only: nothing of it
 * reaches the working model's context.
 *
 * What the writer is told is picked by the judge too: every step, item
 * ticked and thing the agent said is logged, and at each look the judge sorts
 * what happened since the last board into news and routine. When the run
 * ends, it picks again over the whole run (the news it picked before, and
 * what came after), and the board sums the run up. So the person has two
 * accounts of the same work: the agent's own, in the conversation, and the
 * board's, in plain words.
 *
 * The board also keeps a running account, so the person is never left with
 * "done" and no idea what was done: every step becomes one fixed sentence the
 * moment it ends (a file changed, a check passed or failed, a command run;
 * reading is folded into one growing line), free of any model call, and
