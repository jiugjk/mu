 * (`process/agent/kyrn/events.ts`) sends it as a tool call with the id `jev:<runtime>:<turn>` and marks its stage in
 * `rawOutput.preflight` (pending, verdict with the verdict's fields, fallback). Conversations recorded before that
 * carry only the English title ("Jev · Classifying", "Jev · <turn type>", "Jev · Fallback"), which is read instead.
 *
 * `hints` are the hints the main model was given with the verdict (`hintIds`, see the harness's
 * kyrn/docs/features/presentation-codes.md), in their order; present only when there are some. The harness sends the
 * verdict again once the turn has started, with them; a rule's hint (`answered`) can come with no class at all.
 *
 * `judge` names the judge that was asked or answered (the verdict's `by`, the wait's `judge`): `jev-latest`, `laya`,
 * a cascade such as `laya>jev-latest`. It is empty for rows that never named one; those were Jev's.
